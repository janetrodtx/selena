# 🎨 Data Visualization Project: The Rise of "Selena"

## Project Overview
Inspired by **Selena Quintanilla's cultural legacy**, this project explores the **popularity trends of the name "Selena"** across the United States over time. Using **publicly available baby name data** from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA), I created interactive and styled visualizations that reflect both data insight and artistic inspiration from my own **lotería-inspired artwork**.

---

## Key Features
- 🎥 **Animated Bar Chart Race**: Visualizes how "Selena" rose and fell in popularity across U.S. states from 1980 to 2020, styled in Selena's signature colors (purple, red, gold).
- 🔍 **Heat Map**: Shows total occurrences of the name "Selena" by U.S. state, highlighting Texas and California as top contributors.
- 🖌️ **Custom Styled Visuals**: Incorporates elements from my lotería-style painting ("El Bidi Bidi Bom Bom") with heart overlays and motion lines, creating a unique fusion of **art + data**.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas
- **Visualization**:
  - `Matplotlib` and `Plotly` for chart creation and heat maps
  - `PIL` for image overlay (heart + motion lines)
  - `FFmpeg` and `Pillow` for animation (bar chart race in MP4/GIF)
- **Design Inspiration**: Original artwork from [@hi.voltage.visuals](https://www.instagram.com/hi.voltage.visuals)
